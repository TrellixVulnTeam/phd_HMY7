============
Figure files
============

Although many of these figures are generated by
the scripts in this repository,
some are manually created.
So, although many of the SVGs in this folder
can be generated,
we commit them anyway so that the final thesis
can be complied easily,
and so that we can track
the finalized versions of plots.

In the final thesis, these figures are converted
to PDFs with Inkscape through the
``phd combine`` command.
Those PDFs are ignored by ``git``,
as they can be generated with the committed SVGs.
