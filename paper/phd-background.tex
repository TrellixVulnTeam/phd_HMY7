\chapter{Background}

??? this thesis draws upon and makes contributions
to what would traditionally be thought of a disparate fields:
phonetics and phonology from linguistics,
psychoacoustics from psychology,
knowledge representation
and artificial neural networks from computer science,
spiking neural networks and
synaptic plasticity rules from computational neuroscience,
dynamical systems and control theory
from systems design engineering,
concretely implemented in software
using principles from software engineering.
As such, not all relevant background can
be given equal coverage.
In this chapter, we assume
that the reader's background
in in computer science or engineering.
We therefore spend more time
reviewing background in linguistics
and neuroscience as they fall outside
of the domain of computer science and engineering,
and so can be considered the problem domain
that we will apply our assumed knowledge to.

\section{Problem domain: human speech}

Human speech is studied in many disciplines
using a variety of scientific methods.
In this thesis, we limit our coverage of human speech
to the disciplines of psychoacoustics,
phonetics and phonology,
and auditory biology.

Psychoacoustics provides a quantitative account
of how the human auditory system
responds to incoming air pressure levels.
As such, it provides a method to verify
that our model responds to sounds
as humans do.
A primary assumption behind this work
is that the human auditory system
has evolved to be adept at processing speech;
psychoacoustics describes many of the ways
in which the human auditory system
manipulates sound,
which we aim to reproduce.???ugh this needs work

Phonetics and phonology
provide insight into the basic units of speech.
While a full conversational system
would draw upon all areas of linguistics,
we believe that phonetics and phonology
provides the most relevant insights
when assessing speech from the level of
incoming air pressure levels.

Auditory neurobiology describes both
the and physical substrate organization
of the system that we aim to emulate.
We do no aim to fully replicate
biological neurons,
but by using a simple approximation
of biological neurons,
we constrain our algorithmic choices
to those that could be implemented
in a biological system.
Similarly, by examining the organization
of the auditory brain structures,
we constrain the space of possible
network topologies
to those that match
a network that we know to be successful.

\subsection{Phonetics and phonology}

from Roach text:

- phonetics: describing the sounds we use in speaking.
  Relating to the way we produce them and the way they sound.
  phonology: more abstract parts of sounds; look at restrictions
  and regularities in a language by studying syllables;
  suprasegmental parts (things that extend over several segments,
  i.e., phonemes).

- phonemes: smallest unit of speech; helpful analogy:
  what can be changed (like letters in an alphabet) such that
  the meaning is the same / different. A and a are the same,
  essentially, just like two similar voicings of a phoneme
  are the same.

  - pick a way to write phonemes (probably IPA, in [square brackets])

  - phonemic transcription: just the phonemes. Phonetic transcription:
    includes diacritics and other marks to differentiate allophones.

- vowels: aa, ii, uu extremes, blend together for other vowels

  ??? show IPA image

  these are pure vowels; there are also diphthongs which consist
  of a movement or glide from one vowel to another (8 in english).
  Then there are triphthongs, which glide from one vowel
  to another then another, without interruption.
  These are tough to voice and to recognize, as the middle
  vowel is barely there.

- larynx (vocal folds, glottis): big deal! differentiate between
  voiced and voiceless phonemes. Can be varied a lot
  to change air pressure, etc. Can vary:
  intensity (speaking vs shouting),
  frequency (low vs high pitch),
  quality (e.g., harsh, breathy, murmured, creaky)

- consonants: constrictions at some point in the vocal tract.
  Plosives: air compressed behind complete constriction then released;
  in English, p t k b d g. (p t k are voiceless, also known as fortis
  for strong; b d g are voiced or lenis for weak).
  Fricatives: narrow passage consonants, make hissing sounds;
  continuant because you can keep making them; e.g., in English, s, f.
  Affricates: begin as plosives, end as fricatives, with same articulator
  (homorganic); e.g., in English, ch, sh.
  Nasals: air escapes only from the nose; in English, n, m, ng.
  Approximants: l is a lateral approximant; r another approximant
  (retroflex in other languages); j(y) and w.

- Syllables: difficult to actually segment a sentence into syllables.
  Native listeners will do it differently. (My thought: syllables
  are a sort of necessary bridge between phonemes and words to make
  it faster to learn how to voice new words in a language. But,
  it's not a one-to-one mapping; there may be multiple syllable
  sequences that go from phoneme -> word, but they'll sound subtly different.)
  Syllables consist of a loud center with little or no obstruction
  of airflow; before and after the center, greater obstruction and/or
  quieter sound.
  Minimum syllable: usually V (or something like shh like shushing someone)
  Syllable w/ onset: CV, CCV
  Syllable w/ coda: VC, VCC
  Syllable w/ onset and coda: CVC CCVCC, etc
  No word begins with more than three consonants.
  A small number of words end with four consonants; none more than four.

- Include? P. 71 syllable structure in English

- Also P. 71 with onset -> rhyme (which is peak -> coda)

- Syllables can be strong or weak (phonetics).
  Weak syllables are shorter, less sound, and have some vowels
  that can't exist in strong syllables. Can also have syllables
  with no vowel (e.g., /l/ in bottle), called syllabic consonant.
  In English, schwa often stands in for other vowels in weak syllables.
  Most vowels show up only (or at least most often) in either strong
  syllables (long vowels, diphthongs) or weak syllables (schwa).

- Stress: in production, this seems like more muscles are used;
  this corresponds to scaling of our trajectory perhaps?
  In perception, they are prominent because:
  1) louder (at least, that's how it feels, though loudness is
  difficult to detect in isolation)
  2) longer
  3) different pitch than other syllables
  4) different quality (e.g., using a vowel associated with strong
     syllables rather than weak; using a bunch of schwas will make
     the other vowels sound more prominent, for example).
  Seems to be three levels of stress (primary, secondary, unstressed).
  In some levels, stress is rule-based (e.g., last syllable in French).
  Not so in English. Only strong syllables can be stressed;
  other rules apply, but there are exceptions, so for some words
  stress is part of the representation. Also matters what part of speech...
  look, it's complicated. ``Generative phonology'' has more to say
  about how this might occur, but in general, we'll leave stress
  at this simplistic level and not concern ourselves with it.

\section{Prior modeling approaches}

In making early steps toward
an integrated speech recognition and synthesis system,
we are applying techniques
in artificial intelligence and control theory
to the speech domain reviewed in the previous section.
There is a long history of applying these techniques
to this domain;
in this section we review prior modeling efforts
and contrast them with the model we will describe
in future chapters.

\subsection{Auditory periphery modeling}

??? figure like izhikevic, with auditory model + efficiency?

??? summary table with phenomena captured, etc

\subsection{Automatic speech recognition}

\subsection{Speech synthesis}

\subsubsection{Articulatory speech synthesis}

??? summary table with different vocal tract models

??? summary table with different acoustic models

??? in the tables, also note available implementations
(so we can justify writing our own).
Include programming language in this

??? include online vs batch in table

\subsection{Speech motor control}

??? note that many art. synths consider this part of their
synthesizer (control model).
But we will consider it separately because
it is a primary contribution of this thesis.

??? Saltzman stuff on task dynamics
is highly related to what we want to do.
But with SPA stuff on top.

??? also hosung nam's work

??? also mention near the end that people haven't
yet connected the Saltzman task dynamics stuff
to the brain; that'll be one of our contributions

\subsection{Integrated recognition and synthesis systems}

??? Review DIVA model

\section{

\subsection{Vector symbolic architectures}

??? make links to knowledge representation in CS

??? give general background for the math in methods?
