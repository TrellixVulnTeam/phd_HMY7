\section{Neural Engineering Framework}

The NEF forces us to make certain decisions
in a biologically plausible way.
Many of the design decisions from Chapter~???refmethods
were constrained in this manner;
for example, implementing LTI systems is natural
in the NEF since dynamics are a core principle.

\section{Semantic Pointer Architecture}

SPA gives us a method to do symbol-like processing
with spiking neural networks created
with the principles of the NEF.
???we don't use much of it,
but we do use it to represent phonemes.
The intention here is to later hook up
this system with other SPA networks
that would do linguistic processing
that can map down to the level of
producing strings of phonemes.

\section{Network diagrams}

???important implementation detail:
should auditory preprocessing be an EnsembleArray
or an ensemble? Maybe both?

??? Given the baseline pitch as input,
relative pitch will be computed
primarily through neural inhibition.
All neurons whose characteristic frequency is below
the baseline pitch will be inhibited;
the relative pitch is then
a smoothed version of the overall activity
of the pitch-sensitive population.
