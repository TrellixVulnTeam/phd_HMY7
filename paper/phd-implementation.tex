\section{Neural Engineering Framework}

The NEF forces us to make certain decisions
in a biologically plausible way.
Many of the design decisions from Chapter~???refmethods
were constrained in this manner;
for example, implementing LTI systems is natural
in the NEF since dynamics are a core principle.

\section{Semantic Pointer Architecture}

SPA gives us a method to do symbol-like processing
with spiking neural networks created
with the principles of the NEF.
???we don't use much of it,
but we do use it to represent phonemes.
The intention here is to later hook up
this system with other SPA networks
that would do linguistic processing
that can map down to the level of
producing strings of phonemes.

\subsection{Word encodings}

Let's use the SPA to encode words,
or any arbitrary string of phonemes.
Consider the word BAT.

$$\text{WORD} = \text{PH1} \circledast \text{B}
  \oplus \text{PH2} \circledast \text{A}
  \oplus \text{PH3} \circledast \text{T}$$

Then, we can decode the phone that we want
by binding with the inverse of the
phone that we're on.
So, for the first phone:

$$\text{B} \approx \text{WORD} \circledast \text{PH1}^{-1}$$

This result would then be sent to a cleanup memory.
Unlike other cleanup memories, however,
the outputs of the cleanup would be oscillators.
These would generate the trajectory of articulators
for each phoneme.

As always, timing is the difficult thing here.
Since these are oscillators, we really want to
just give them a kick, so the cleanup shouldn't
be cleaning up all the time, just when
we query for the next phoneme.
The kick should also advance the query
to the next phone,
so that the next kick gets the next phone.

We'd need to build in some structure to the SPs
representing phone positions.

$$\text{PH2} = \text{PH1} \circledast \text{NEXTPH}$$

And so on.

\section{Network diagrams}

???important implementation detail:
should auditory preprocessing be an EnsembleArray
or an ensemble? Maybe both?

??? Given the baseline pitch as input,
relative pitch will be computed
primarily through neural inhibition.
All neurons whose characteristic frequency is below
the baseline pitch will be inhibited;
the relative pitch is then
a smoothed version of the overall activity
of the pitch-sensitive population.
