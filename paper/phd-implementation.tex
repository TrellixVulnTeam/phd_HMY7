\section{Neural Engineering Framework}

The NEF forces us to make certain decisions
in a biologically plausible way.
Many of the design decisions from Chapter~???refmethods
were constrained in this manner;
for example, implementing LTI systems is natural
in the NEF since dynamics are a core principle.

\section{Network diagrams}

???important implementation detail:
should auditory preprocessing be an EnsembleArray
or an ensemble? Maybe both?

??? Given the baseline pitch as input,
relative pitch will be computed
primarily through neural inhibition.
All neurons whose characteristic frequency is below
the baseline pitch will be inhibited;
the relative pitch is then
a smoothed version of the overall activity
of the pitch-sensitive population.
