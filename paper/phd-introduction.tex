Lofty long term goal of this type of work:
natural interactions between humans and computers
by enabling computers to communicate through
similar means as humans.

Reasonable short term goal is an integrated
speech recognition and synthesis system
that can form the basis of many future
experiments in speech science.
The goal of the experiments would be to
form an tight loop between
theory and experimentation;
the model incorporates theoretical
assumptions based on past experiments.
We can make predictions with the model
that will lead to future experiments,
the results of which we can then
incorporate back into the model.

Toward this goal,
we have incorporated N existing
theoretical models into the system,
and tested them in M experiments
demonstrating where these models
match or differ from known data.
We also make X predictions
based on the results of these experiments,
and from the neural structures
designed to connect
the models used in the recognition
and synthesis systems.

While the external interfaces
and initial processing layers of
the presented model are based on
past theoretical work,
the higher level processing
of incoming sound,
the system controlling
auditory synthesizers,
and the integrated system
summarizing and routing
phonetic information from
the recognition to the synthesis system
are novel contributions of this thesis.
??? something about which conclusions
needed the integrated stuff.
